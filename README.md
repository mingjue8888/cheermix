**CheerMix** is an integrated framework based on **Express** and other tool libraries. **CheerMix** selects tool libraries that are lighter, more robust, easier to learn and less demanding, allowing developers to focus more on their services. Code is designed to help developers build servers more quickly. **CheerMix** integrates these tools very well. It is simply an art, making your code written more declarative and functional. You can even view the code as a document, programming and writing documents are the same.
